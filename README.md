## Overview

**Project Title**:
To Do List

**Project Description**:
This is the To do list app, i developed it in IOS, the database is using a cloud database calle Firebase. The database handles user authentication and the storage of new To-Do items. Users can login and will have all their previous tasks at a glance.


**Project Goals**:
Make an Ios app that would have user authentication, track new tasks, the status of tasks and allow the user to delete old tasks. 
I beleive its a simple yet effective way to help get more done.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. You will need xcode and a developer account
2. open up the files in Xcode
3. You will need to create a firebase project and link in the necessary files to Xcode
4. Once that is done you should be able to run the app in the simulator or with some extra setup can download it for use directly on your phone.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open up the app and create a new user account or if you have one already login with your credentials.
2. Once you are logged in you can press the plus icon to add more tasks to the app. 
3. When you are done with a task you can check it off or even delete when finished.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] When logging in the keyboard can block the login forms and its slightly annoying, I'd like to fix that if possible.
* [ ] Notifications or reminders for tasks would be nice.
* [ ] ability to share a list with someone.
